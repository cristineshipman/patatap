## Created a clone of the patatap app.


### This app was created using the [paper.js](http://paperjs.org/ "Paperjs Homepage") library for graphics animations and [howler.js](https://howlerjs.com/ "howler.js Homepage") library for audio.

### This was made by digging into the docs of these libraries and figuring out how to incorporate some external code into my own app.
